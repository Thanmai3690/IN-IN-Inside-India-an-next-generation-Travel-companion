  # Title

IN-IN (Inside India)
A Next-Gen Travel Companion

  # Problem Statement

Existing travel apps prioritize logistics over experience.
They offer static, one-size-fits-all recommendations.
There is no emotional, cultural, or contextual understanding.
Travelers reach destinations but miss meaningful connections.

  # Project strategy summary

IN-IN uses a structured and context-aware prompt strategy to provide personalized travel experiences.
User inputs like location, budget, time, mood, and preferences are combined into one clear prompt.
The AI is guided to focus on Indian culture, local experiences, emotions, and safety, not generic tourism.

Different prompt templates are used for:

  →Itinerary planning

  →Best photo time and spots

  →Local food and souvenir suggestions

  →Real-time updates based on crowd, events, and time

Each prompt follows a simple flow:
User Context → Travel Intent → Constraints → Desired Experience, ensuring meaningful and relevant results.

  –Suggests best photo spots and timings

  –Recommends authentic food and local souvenirs

  –Provides emotion-based travel guidance

  –Shows nearby facilities and emergency support

  –Enhances meaningful travel experiences in India
